As a final project of the bootcamp we had to develop a RESTful API of a bank system following some basic guidelines. It was an individual project, therefore we couldn't get help from teachers nor from other students, and we had two weeks to make it.

The tech stack used for the project, and the one we've worked with during the bootcamp, is Java, MySQL for database management and Spring Boot for microservices creation. I've worked with good practices for easy readibility, coherence and understanding of the business logic. 

For the development of the program I've started with a class diagram in UML, which follows the structure indicated by the project guidelines: it should have 3 types of users (account holders, admins and third parties), and 4 types of accounts (checking, student checking, savings and credit card accounts), each one with specific attributes and properties. I continued with the creation of the different classes  with the necessary attributes, and established the relationships between them, for which the diagram helped a lot, as it's a clear and precise way of reflecting what's later going to be a complex coding structure. After that, I've created the repositories with the necessary queries, and later the services with the business logic. I've included methods for creating the different accounts, and a transfer
funciton which included the deduction and deposit method in the respective accounts. Other methods are included, such as the penalty fee and the interest rate method. At last I've made the controllers, which included several endpoints for the methods developed before. I've included an exception handler at API level, which throws errors 400, 401, 403, 404 and 500. I've also included spring security with JWT and roles, for authentication and authorization, and several integration tests to test the key methods of the controllers.
